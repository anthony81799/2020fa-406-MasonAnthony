# Blogger Lab 4
The current blogger app. has five pages. A homepage, blog list, blog Add, blog edit, and blog delete.  Users can see all current blogs displayed with their titles and created on dates.  Users can also add, edit, and delete blogs.  Any of these three actions redirect to the updated list upon success.
