# Blogger Lab 5
The current blogger app. has five pages. A homepage, blog list, blog Add, blog edit, and blog delete.  Users can see all current blogs displayed with their titles and created on dates.  Users can also add, edit, and delete blogs.  Any of these three actions redirect to the updated list upon success.

The lab 5 version of the blogger app has the same functionality as stated above, but it is implimented with angular instead of using an express view engine.
