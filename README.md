# Blogger Lab 7
The current blogger app. has seven pages. A homepage, blog list, blog Add, blog edit, blog delete, login, and register.  Users can see all current blogs displayed with their titles and created on dates.  Users can also add, edit, and delete blogs.  Any of these three actions redirect to the updated list upon success.  Users can now register, login, and logout on the site.  Blogs can only be edited or deleted by their creator.
